# YT-peek
This is a tool to make YT channel monitor on mobile easy, fast and simple
# Future Plans
I hope to gather a lot of people to help me out working on this open source project, i never really made anything thats ppen sourced i have only every work alone

-New Features including-

-account signup (make it monitor your account)

-GUI overhall

-privacy update

-moving it from html to a functionable app for mobile (maybe PC support later)

etc.

# How To Help

currently every feature is in the html file just download it and run it in your browser simple 
so modifying the html code to detect and use new function is the thing you can do for now :)

# What Your Allowed To Do
you can make any changes real but only if you understand the code

you can also real this as another distro so as long as you credit the main

# roadmap
I am lost and using Google maps to help me find my ways home (a joke)
